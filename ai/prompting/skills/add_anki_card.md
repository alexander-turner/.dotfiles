description: Generate high-quality Anki flashcards from highlights, notes, or source material. Use when creating cloze deletions, basic cards, or image occlusion cards. Applies spaced repetition best practices including the minimum information principle, atomic card design, and proper cloze formulation. Transforms raw highlights into effective retrieval practice rather than mere copying.

# Flashcard Generator Skill

Generate effective Anki flashcards optimized for long-term retention.

## Core Principle: Minimum Information

Each card tests **exactly one concept**. This is non-negotiable.

**Why:** Simple items create reliable neural pathways. Complex cards cause interference, inconsistent grading, and abandonment.

**Test:** Can this card be answered in under 8 seconds with zero ambiguity?

## Card Type Selection

| Content Type                                | Best Card Format                  |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Fact within context (dates, names, numbers) | Cloze deletion                    |
| Definition or vocabulary                    | Basic (front/back)                |
| Conceptual "why/how" questions              | Basic with explanation            |
| Visual/spatial (anatomy, diagrams, maps)    | Image occlusion                   |
| Ordered sequences or lists                  | Cloze overlapper (multiple cards) |

## Cloze Deletion Rules

### Syntax

```
{{c1::hidden text}}
{{c1::hidden::hint shown during review}}
```

### When Cloze Works Best

- Facts embedded in explanatory sentences
- Medical/scientific facts with relationships
- Language learning (grammar particles, conjugations)
- Dates and numbers with context

### Cloze Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Multiple deletions from one paragraph:**

```
{{c1::Mitochondria}} are organelles that produce {{c2::ATP}} through {{c3::oxidative phosphorylation}}.
```

✅ **Separate atomic cards:**

```
Card 1: The organelle primarily responsible for ATP production is the {{c1::mitochondria}}.
Card 2: Mitochondria produce ATP through {{c1::oxidative phosphorylation}}.
```

❌ **Answer given away by question structure:**

```
Hyperventilation causes what type of alkalosis? → {{c1::Respiratory}}
```

✅ **Requires actual knowledge:**

```
Hyperventilation affects acid-base balance by causing {{c1::respiratory alkalosis}} due to {{c2::CO2 loss}}.
```

❌ **Ambiguous without context:**

```
{{c1::EBV}}
```

✅ **Clear what's being tested:**

```
Oral hairy leukoplakia is caused by {{c1::EBV (Epstein-Barr virus)}}.
```

```

## Basic Card Rules

### Front (Question)
- One specific question
- Include context cues if the term is ambiguous
- Avoid yes/no questions (test recognition, not recall)
- "What/Why/How" > "Is/Does/Can"

### Back (Answer)
- Concise—ideally one sentence or phrase
- Include mnemonic or memory hook if helpful
- Add source reference (not tested, just for review)

### Example Transformation

❌ **Direct copy from highlight:**
```

Q: What are the characteristics of the Dead Sea?
A: Salt lake on Israel-Jordan border. Lowest point on Earth at 396m below sea level. 74 km long. Seven times saltier than ocean. Only simple organisms survive.

```

✅ **Atomic cards testing understanding:**
```

Q: Where is the Dead Sea located?
A: Border between Israel and Jordan

Q: What is the lowest point on Earth's surface?
A: The Dead Sea shoreline (~400m below sea level)

Q: Why is the Dead Sea called "dead"?
A: Only simple organisms can survive its extreme salinity (7× ocean)

```

## Image Occlusion Guidelines

**Use for:** Anatomy, diagrams, maps, circuits, any spatial/visual information.

**Process:**
1. Use high-quality source image (textbook, medical atlas)
2. Occlude ONE structure per card (or closely related group)
3. Include labels or context in the visible portion
4. Test: "Given everything else visible, can I identify what's hidden?"

**Modes:**
- **Hide All, Guess One:** All regions hidden, reveal one at a time (harder)
- **Hide One, Guess One:** Only target hidden, context visible (easier, often better)

## Converting Highlights to Cards

Never copy highlights directly. Transform them:

1. **Identify the core fact** — What specific knowledge does this contain?
2. **Formulate a question** — What question would this answer?
3. **Check atomicity** — Does this test ONE thing?
4. **Add context** — Will future-you understand what's being asked?
5. **Remove redundancy** — Is every word necessary?

### Highlight → Card Workflow

```

Highlight: "The prefrontal cortex, which doesn't fully mature until age 25,
is responsible for executive functions including decision-making,
impulse control, and planning."

→ Generated cards:

1. The {{c1::prefrontal cortex}} is responsible for executive functions
   (decision-making, impulse control, planning).

2. The prefrontal cortex doesn't fully mature until age {{c1::25}}.

3. Q: What are the three main executive functions of the prefrontal cortex?
   A: Decision-making, impulse control, and planning

## Quality Checklist

Before outputting any card, verify:

| Check | Question |
|-------|----------|
| Atomic | Tests exactly ONE concept? |
| Unambiguous | Only one correct answer possible? |
| Fast | Answerable in <8 seconds? |
| Clear | Future-self will understand the question? |
| Understanding | Tests recall, not just recognition? |
| Standalone | Makes sense without seeing source material? |
| Order | Information needed to recall the missing answer is present before the answer slot. Cloze deletions should never be at the beginning of the card. They should be near the end. |

## Output Format

Default to CSV format for Anki import:

```csv
Front,Back,Tags
"Question text","Answer text","source::book-name, chapter::3"
````

For cloze:

```csv
Text,Extra,Tags
"The {{c1::mitochondria}} produces ATP.","Source: Biology Ch.4","biology, cell-organelles"
```

## What NOT to Create Cards For

- Information you don't understand yet (learn first, memorize second)
- Trivia without application
- Easily searchable facts you'll never need quickly
- Content better suited to reference lookup than memory

## Handling Lists and Sequences

Never create cards like:

```
Q: What are the 5 stages of grief?
A: Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression, Acceptance
```

Instead, test meaningful subsets:

```
Q: What stage of grief involves "if only" thinking?
A: Bargaining
```

## Tagging Convention

Recommended tag structure:

- `source::` — Where the information came from
- `topic::` — Subject area hierarchy (topic::biology::cell)
- `type::` — Card type (cloze, basic, image-occlusion)
- `status::` — Review status if needed (status::needs-review)
